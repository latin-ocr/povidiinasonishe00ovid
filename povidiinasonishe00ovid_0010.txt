vi INTRODUGTION,

of his affection ς his second was of hlameless character, but
from her also he was soon divorced. One of these two
Iadies, we know not which, belonged to the Etrurian tribe,
whose chief town was Falerii (santa Maria di Faleri). His
third wife was of the noble Fabian family. To her he was
deeply attached, and she remained fond and true to the last,
supporting him by her faithful affection during the mis·
fortunes which darkened the close of his life.

For a long period fortune had smiled steadily upon Ovid.
He was now upwards of fifty years old 3 the greater part of
this time he had spent at Rome, in ease, tranquillity, and
happiness. His time was completely nt his own disposal‚
and he could devote what portion of it he pleased to his
favourite pursuits5 his works were universally popular;
he was the companion and friend of all the great political
and literary characters of that brilliant epoch ; he enjoyed
the favour and patronage of the Emperor himself. But he
was not destined to end his days in peace. Towards the
end of A.D. 8 an order was suddenly conveyed to him from
Aug-ustus, commanding that he should instantly quit the
metropolis, and fix his residence at Tomi, a colony planted
among the Getae, in the midst of harbarous and hostile
tribes, on the bleak shores of the Euxine, near the mouth of
the Danube. To hear was to obey. Paralysed by grief, he
tore himself from the arms of his afflicted wife, and set
forth in the dead of winter for the place of his destination
which he reached the following spring.

The cause of this banishmcnt is a prohlem which has
excited the curiosity and exercised the ingenuity of learned
men ever since the revival of letters, bnt it is one which our
present sources of knowledge do not enable us to solve.
The ostensible reason was the immoral tenclency of the
Ars Amatoria, but the most probable is that hehad become
accidentally acquainted with some of the intrigues of J ulia,
the profligate granddaughter of the Emperor, whose well-
known sensibility in all matters affecting the honour of his
family rendered him unable to tolerate the presence of a
man who had been an eye-witness to the infamy of one of
its mcmbers.
