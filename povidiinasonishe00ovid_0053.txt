HEROIDES. V. 19

43. Parce negare, i.e. noli negare, cave neges.

This use of the verb ‘ parco ² is very common among the
poets, although scarcely admissible in prose composition,
e.g. Hor. Od. 3. 8, 26,

Parce privatus nimium cavere,

and Virg. E. 3. 94,
Parcite, oves m'mimn procedere non bene ripae
Oredibur.
44. Praeterito, ‘the love which once you bore ‘to me,
but which now has passed away.'

45. Nostros vidisti flentis ocellos, i.e. mei flentis
ocellos. This peculias construction, by which the possessive

pronoun is substituted for the genitive of the personal‚ is
found occasionally in the best writers.

quum mea ‘nemo
Scripta, lassat vulfio recitare timentis. Hor. S. I. 4, 22.

The same idiom is found in Greek, Hom. Il. 3. 180.

46. Miscuimus.. suas. ·' We both in sorrow mingled our
tears.”

49. Cum te...teneri. ‘ then thou didst complain of
being detained by the wind.⁷ ’

50. Ille Secundus erat· ‘ Scilicet mihi amanti, quia tc
retinebat, nec illo flante abire poteras ’ Β.

Α singular misapprehension of the meaning. Oenone
intends to say that when the wind was really favourablc for
the voyage, Paris, unable to ‘tear himself from her arms,

and eager to frame an excuse for (lelay‚ complained that it
was adverse, a pretext so flimsy that ‘ riserunt comites. ”
