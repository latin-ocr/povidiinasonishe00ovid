HEROIDES. v. 17

24. Recta, although found in most MSS„ is scarcely
intelligible, since it cannot be connected either with ‘ trunci’
or ‘ nomina.’ ‘ Rite,’ which appears in two MSS„ is pro-2
bably the true reading. ‘ Recte' was perhaps placed in the
margin as an explanation of ‘ rite,' and might then find its
way into the text, and finally would be changed into ‘reeta‚⁷

to prevent a violation of the laws of prosody.

25. Consita. ‘ Sero’ and its compounds are used per-
petually by Virgil and the prose writers upon agriculture,
in the sense of ‘ to plant.' as well as in that of ‘ to sow.'

27. Popule. Distinguish between populus and populus·

Quae hoc...habes. ‘ Which...hast these lines inscribed
on thy rough bark.'

30. Ad fontem. 'Phe expression of rivers running back-
wards seems to have been applied proverbially, among the
Greeks, to anything which was so strange as to seem a vio-
lation os the laws of nature. So the chorus in the M‹=dea
of Euripides, and in like manner Horace, when expressin g
his astonishment at the resolution of Iccius, Od. 1. 29, 10:

Quis neqet arduis
Pronos relabi posse rivos
illontibus, ec Tiberim reverti.

31. Lymphae. ‘ Et lympha et nympha pro aqua ponitur;
verum ubi poetae aquis actionem quandam humanam tri-
buunt, nympham potius quam lympham, dicunt.—-—Itaque

Heius. e MSS. emendat nymphae R.

The two words, as might be expected from their resem-

blance both in form and meaning, are perpetually eonfoundod
in MSS.
