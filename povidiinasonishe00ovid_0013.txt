INTRonuc'rrox. ix

Epistolae ex Ponto are addressed to different individuals,
for the most part persons residing at Rome and connected
with the Court, who are implored to use their good offices
with the Emperor and the different members of the royal
family.

IX. Ibis. Six hundred and forty-six lines in Elegiae
verse, consisting of a series of maledictions poured forth
against an enemy whose name is concealed, written immedi-
ately after the banishnient of the poet, as we learn from the
commencement,

‘ Tempus ad hoc, lustris iam bis mihi quinque peractis,
Omne fuit Musae cannen inerme meac.’

It is an imitation of a lost poem by Callimachus, directed
against Apollonius of Rhodes, and bearing the same title.
The origin of the appellation is unknown.

X. Halieuticon Liber. A mutilated fragment, in Hex-
ameter verse, of a Natural History of Fishes. One hundred

and thirty—two lines only have been preserved.

XI Medicamina Faciei. Another fragment, in Elegiae
verse, of a didactic poem on the composition and use of cos-

metics. Of this one hundred lines remain.

Two othei· pieces are frequently found in MSS. of Ovid,
but the best critic-S are of opinion that both must bc attri-
buted to some other author or authors. The first of these,
‘ Consolatio ad Liviam Augustan is a sort of dirge on the
Death of Drusus, who pegished in Gmnany, 9 ΗΟ. It is
in Elegiae verse, and extends to four hundred and seventy-
four lines. The other, also in Elegiae verse, and containing
one hundred and eighty-two lines, is entitled ‘ Nux,' and is
a lamentation poured forth by a walnut-tree on account of
the indignities offered to it by travellers and passers by,
followed up by a declamation against the avarice and pro·
ssigacy of the age in general.

Ovid in early life cultivated dramatic literature, and, it
would seem, with marked succeSS, for his tragedy ‘ Medea ’
is highly extolled by Quinctilian.
