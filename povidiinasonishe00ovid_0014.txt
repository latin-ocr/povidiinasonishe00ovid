x INTRODUCi'ION.

The metre in which the Heroides is eomposed is the so-
ealled Elegiae couplet, that is, a Hexameter, or ordinary
Heroic line (like that of Virgil’s AEneid), followed by a
Daetylie Pentameter‚ which was hardly ever used bui: in eon-
nection with the Hexameter. The fossowing is a scheme of
the present way of scanning the Elegiae couplet :

(1) -vzu—vv1—vv1—vv1—Vvl——

An older way of scanning the Penfiameter was ε

{lat is,twith a Spondee in the middle followed by two
napa-s s,

1. The Hexameber 0011515135 of six feet, of which 1116 fifth
is a DactyL izhe sixbh a Spondee, while the first four may
be Dactyls or Spondues. Licenses of any kind are but
sparingly admitted in the Hexameter of this couplet.

2. The Dactylie pentameter, as usually scanned, consists
of two members separated by the Penthemimeral pause.
The first member has two feet—Daetvls or Spondees—fol-
lowed by a long syllable ; the second member is made up
of two Dactyls followed by a syllable, which, whether long
or short, is considered long.

Ovid, who present-3 13116 best‘models of Elegiae verse,
usually observes the following, among other rules ε

(α) If the sense overflow the limits of the Hexameter,

and be completed in the first word of the Pentameter‚ then
the first foot of this latter should be a Dactyl.

(h) Elisions should bo sparingly employed.

(c) Each couplet should make sense by itself.
