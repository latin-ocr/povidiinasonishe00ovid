HERomsss. xm. 41

(56. Signatum...habe. ‘ Have his name iinprinted on
thy mindful breast.'

67. vitaris, contr. for vitaveris.

68. Hectoras, h. e. multos viros fortes qualis Hector R.
So Sueton. Caes. Ι. Caesari multos illarlos inesse. It is a
very common English idiom.

69. Facito ut, dicas, i.e., ⁶ Fail not to repeat!

70. Parcere Sibi. Laodamia intimates that if her hus-
band perishes she Will also die.

71. Si...fas est. ‘If it. be the will of heaven.’ ‘ Fas' pro-

perly denotes divine law, while human institutions are
called ‘ jura.'

74. U‘b rapiat...et armis. ‘That he may take from
Paris what Paris before took from him. Let him rush on ;

and him, whom he conquers in the justice of his cause may
he conquer, too, in arms !’

74, 75. The genuineness of these two lines has been called
in question, in consequence of their being omitted in several
MSS. Moreover, ‘sibi' is sfflrtfing, where we should have
expected ‘illi‚' but this difficulty may be explained, by
supposing that the speaker puts himself, in fancy, in the
place of Menelaus.

77. Dispar, ⁴ unlike ‘ that of Menelaus.

77. Vivere pugna. ‘ Pugnare' frequently significs ‘ to
struggle‚’ ‘ to make an effort to attain some object,’ and in
this sense it is construed with the infinitive by the poets, as
in the passage before us.
