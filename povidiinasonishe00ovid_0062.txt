24 NOTEs.

94. Deiphobo. Deiphobus, after Hector, was the best
and bravest of all the sons of Priam and Hecuba. We are
told in the Odyssey, 8. 517, that his house was stormed at
the capture of Troy by Ulysses and Menelaus, and later
writers represented him as having wedded Helen after the
death of Paris. This account was followed by Virgfl, and
the student will do well to read the description of the inter—

view between Aeneas and the shade of Deiphobus, in the
realms belom Ae. 6. 494.

Polydamanta. Polydamas, son of Panth6os a Delpffian,
who had settled at Troy and wedded the niece of Priam, is
repeatedly introduced in the Iliad, and represented as one
of the wisest, as well as the most valiant, in the 'Trojan
host. With regard to the orthography ‘ Graece dieitur
H ουλύδ αμας sed Latinum Polydamas priori syllaba longa;
formatum est ex Aeolico Πωλύδαμας ’ R.. Hence it is
quite uunecessary to write the name ‘ Pulydamas‚’ as some
desire.

95. Antenor. Antenor, husband of Theano, the sister
of Hecuba, is characterized by Homer as an aged, wisc, and
eloquent counsellor, holding the same position among the
Trojans which Nestor occupied among the Greeks. Tra-
dition told, that having escaped from the sack of his native
city, he led a band of exiles, who wandered to ‘the head of
the Adriatic and founded the city of Patavium. So Virgil,
Ae. Ι. 242.

96. Quis-„fust- ‘ To whom their long life has been a
teaeher.’

97. Turpe...rapta.m. ‘ It is a base beginning to prefer
a woman carried off, to thy country.’
