EPIST. V.—OENONE PARIDI.

’ The loves of Paris and Oenone, and the legend regard-
ing the birth and early history of the former, which form
the groundwork of this epistle‚ were unknown to Homer.
What follows is the substance of the tale as narrated by
Apollodorus,

Hector was the first-born of Priam and Hecuba. When
Hecuba was about to produce a second child, she dreamed
that she had given birth to a blazing torch, which kindled
a conflagration that spread over the whole city. Priam,
having been informed by her of the vision, seni: for Aesacus
(his son by Arisbe, a former wife), who was skilled in the
interpretation of dreams, an art which he had been taught
by Merops, his maternal grandfather. Aesacus pronounced
that the boy would prove the destru 3tion of his country,
and bade them expose the babe. - Priam, as soon as it was
born, gave it to one of his herdinen, named Agelaus, to be
conveyed to Ida and there abandoned. The infant, left to
perish‚ was nurtured for five days by a she-bear, when
Agelaus, finding it thus miraculously preserved, took it up
and bore it to his dwelling, where hc reared it as his own
son, under the name of Paris. The child having grown up
to manhood, excelled both in comeliness and valour, and
soon received the additional appellation of Alexander,
because he withstood and drove away the robbers who
attacked the flocks. Not long after he discovered his
parents.
