LIFE AND WORKS OF OVID.

Publius Ovidius Naso was born on the 20111 of hlarch (the
second day of the* ‘ Quinquatria’), 43 B.C., the year 111 which

Α the battles fought against Antony under the walls of Modena

proved fatal to Hirtius and Pansa, in which the second
triumvirate was formed, and in which Cicero perished. The
place Of his nativity was Sulmo (Sulmone), a town in the
cold moist hills of the Peligni, one of 11ιο Sabine clans,
situated at a short distance to the SME of Corfinium, about
