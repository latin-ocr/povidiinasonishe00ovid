INTRODUCTION. xi

(cl) The Pentameter should end in a dissyllable, which
should be some emphatic part of speech.

(e) The last syllable, if short, should end in a consonant.

(f) If the last, syllable of the first member of the Pen-
tameter be a monosyllable (which should rarely happen),
another long monosyllable should precede, 01· a dissyllaffle
of two short syllables. An exception to this is admitted in
the case of the monosyllable est, when ‘che preceding vowel
is elided.
