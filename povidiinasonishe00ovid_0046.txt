16 NOTES.

15. Super stramen fenoque jacentibus. Remark the
change in the construction of ‘ stramen ’ and ‘ feno!

16. Defensa. ‘Defendere' signifies properly ‘to ward
off‚' so Virg. E. 7. 47,

δὀἶΒέίίὶῑιΊη pecori defendite, jam venit aestas,
aud Senec. de Prov. 4,

Imbrem culmo aut fronde defendunt.

19. Maculis. The knots of a net seem to be indicated
by ‘maculae.' N. Heins. would understand the coloured
feathers employed to scaro the beasts of chase, and drive
them into the toils, as in Virg. G. 3. 372.

Hos (sc. cervo-3) non immissis canibus, non cassibus ullis,
Puniceaeve αῃίίαηε trepidos formidine pennae.

Scheller in his Lexicon says the ‘ maculae’ are the ‘meshes'
or ‘ holes ’ of the net. The word cannot bear either of the
two last mentioned significations in the following passage
from Varro, R. R. 3. 11, where heis giving directions for
the construction of a νησόοτροφεῖον or dach-yard.
After describing the manner in which the wall is to be
built and plastered‚ he continues—irlqeae saeptmn totum rete
yranclibzcs maculas irzteqicar ne eo involare aquila possit, neve
ew eo evolare anas ,·—and so Columella, 8. 15, almost in the
same words. In these passages ⁴ grandibus maculis' must
mean ‘strong knots‚' for ‘large meshes’ would admit of
the very evil which the farmer is here taught to guard
against.

20. Per juga. longa.. ‘ Over the long mountain ranges!

22. Legor...tua. ‘ Ι am read of as thine.'
