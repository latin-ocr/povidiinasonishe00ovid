m'rnonuc'rrox. vii

Ninety—six poemsin Elegiae verse serve as a sad chronicle
of the sufferings he endured during his journey, and while
in exile. They exhibit a melancholy picture of the mental
prostration of the gay, witty, voluptuous Roman, suddenly
snatched from the midst of the most polished society of the
age, from the exciting pleasures of the capital of the world,
from the charms of a delicious climate, and abandoned to
his own resources among a horde of rude soldier peasants,
in a remote half-civilized frontier garrison, beneath a Scy-
thian sky. Notwithstanding the exertions of many and
nowerful friends 3 notwithstanding the expostfflations, en-
treaties, prayers, and servile abasement of the unfortunate
victim, Augustus and his successor Tiberius remained alike
inexorable, and Ov1d died of a broken heart in the sixtieth
year of his age, and in the tenth of his banishment.

The following list contains all the works usually attributed
to Ovid now extant, arranged -111 the order in which they
were composed, in so iar as this can be ascertained. Doubts
have been entertained with regard to the three last of the
series, numbered ΙΧ., Χ., ΧΙ., but they are generally re-
ceived as authentic :—

Ῑ. Heroides. A collection of twenty-one letters in Ele-
giae verse, feigned to have been written by ladies or chiefs
in the Heroic age to the absent objects of their love. Doubts
have been entertained by some critics, hut without good
reason, of the genuineness of the last six of these3 others
confine their suspicions to the seventeenth, nineteenth‚ and
twenty-first3 while a third party object to the fifteenth
alone. The pieces rejected are attributed to Aulus Sabinus,
a contemporary poet, the author of several epistles in
answer to those composed by ovid, three of which have
been preserved, and are frequently appended to complete
editions of the works of the latter.

Π. Amores, v. Libri Amorum. Forty nine elegios,
chlessy upon amatorv subjects, originally divided by the

ξοείίί into five books, 'but subsequently reduced by himself
0 nee.
