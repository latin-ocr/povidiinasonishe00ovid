Eunomus. V. 21
55. Purpura„ ‘ A purple garment.’

66. Cultus. ‘ Apparel)

69. Morabar. ‘ Haec non intelligo: forte rectius ‘morabor
cum Leidensi codiee' H. The meaning is this :

‘ It was not enough that Ι beheld with fiuttering heart a.
woman's cheek—for had that been enough to satisfy me of
your infidelity, why did I madly linger? No, I did not
believe the worst, until, upon a nearer viem I saw an im-
pure mistress clasped in your embraoe-—there was no longer
any room for doubt—Tunc vero rupique simos et pectora
planaei,' &c-

Heusinger and J ahu-read

N on satis idfuerat ,Ρ quid enim furiosa morabar :⁹

but the interrogation of the first member of the clause does
not suit the ‘ quid enim’ which follows. Ruhnken, who
adopts this punctuation, understands it thus ¹. ‘ Cur me non
subduxi, ut Helenam ne viderem in gremio tuo haerentem. ’
The explanation of Burmann is harder to understand than

the passage itself.

71. Sinus, i.e., vestes. Properly speaking, ‘the folds
of the garmeni: 3‘ it is used in the same general sense in
Ep. 13, 36, .
Indue reyalcs, Laodamia, sinus.
Rupi· ‘ I rent.'

73. Idam v. Iden. A number of nouus of the first
deolension‚ chiefly proper names. are employed by the poets,
sometimes under their Greek, sometimes under their Latin
shape‚ as best suits their purpose. Thus we have ‘ Ida' and
‘Ide 3’ ‘ Leda,’ ‘ Lede ;’ ‘ Helena,' ‘ Helene ς’ ‘ (¹1·eta,’
