HERoinEs. v. 29

ovid here follows Callimachus and Rhianus the Thracian,
in assigning love as t-he cause of the sojourn of Apollo upon
earth in the guise of a herdsman.

The more common legend, as given by Euripides and
Apollodorus, told that Zeus having destroyed Aesculapius,
Apollo, in vengeance, slew the Cyclopes, or their sons, who
had forged the thunderbolts, and was sentenced by the
king of heaven to serve as bondsman to a morta] for the
space of a year. He accordingly entered the service of
Admetus, son of Pheres, the king of Pherae in Thessaly,
and tended his cattle on the banks of the river Amphrysus,

A third account, that of Alexandrides the Delphian,
assigned the slaughter of the Python as the cause of the
punishment of Apollo. The whole of these tales, and the
authorities for them, will be found enumerated in the Scho-
vlium on the first line of that most touching of dramas, the
Alcestis of Euripides.
