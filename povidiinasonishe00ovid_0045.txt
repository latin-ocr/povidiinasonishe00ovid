HEROIDES. v. 15

Oebren is mentioned, as we have seen above, in the narra-
tive of Apollodorus. Geographers fix the site of ‘ Cebreney
near the sources of the ‘Mendere' (which some identify
with the Scamander, and others with the Simois of Homer)
in mo'uut Ida. Extensive ruins mark the spot, now called
‘Kutohunlu-Tepe,' and a little way above these a small
stream, believed to'be the ‘ German, ' falls into the ‘Mendere,'
and fis called the ‘ Kaz-daghbohai.' With regard to the epi-
thet ‘ Pegasis,' we may observe that the Muses are styled
‘ Pegasides ' by Propert. 3. 1, 19, ’
