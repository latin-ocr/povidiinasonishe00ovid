14 NorEs.

While, yet a shepherd in the hills, he wedded Oenone,
daughter of the river Cebren. This nymph, having learned
the art of prophecy from Rhea, warned Alexander not to
sail in quest of Helen 3 but finding that her remonstrances
were unheeded, she then enjoined him, should he be wounded,
to come to her for aid, since she alone had power to heal
him. After this Paris bore away Helen from Sparta, and
being pierced, during the war against Troy, by an arrow
shot by Philoctetes from the bow of Hercules, he returned
again to Ida to seek Oenone’s aid. But she, cherishing re-
Sentment‚ refused to exert her skill. Alexander was borne
back to Troy, and there expired. Oenone having repented,
brought drugs to heal his wound, and finding him a corpse‚
hanged herself for grief.

It will be seen that Ovid adheres, for the most part, closely
to the above tale, departing from it in one or two points

only.
